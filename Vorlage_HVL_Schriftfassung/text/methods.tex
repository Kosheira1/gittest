\section{Simulation of vacuum capacitance} 
The dependency of the vacuum capacity $C_0$ has to be simulated numerically for the high-voltage setup as well as for the low-voltage setup.

There are several systematic errors that influence the vacuum capacity. One factor is the air gap between the wall of the low-voltage setup and the specimen. This air gap is unavoidable in order to be able to remove the specimen from the pouring setup. This air gap should theoretically be 0.5 mm, but it is expected to vary in worst-case between 0 mm and 1 mm. The lookup table of d based on $C_0$ is based on an air gap of 0.5 mm, therefore the deviation from this value has to be investigated. 
Another systematic error is the deviation of the height of the specimen. During  the pouring process the height of the specimen cannot be . The maximum deviation is expected to be $\pm$ 0.5 mm. This deviation might occur during the production process of each new specimen. Thus, if the electrode distance of a specimen should be estimated by the method described in !!! this 
A third influence is the

The estimation of the dielectric permittivity. If one wants to estimate the $\epsilon$ of the dielectric material one has to investigate the dependency for  magnitude and phase of the $\epsilon$ on the $epsilon_eff$. The following 

\section{Signal analysis of the Debye model}

In order to emulate different dielectrica with their own respective dielectric loss tangent, different combinations of circuit elements were used. Each different circuit accounts for another loss tangent with respect to frequency. With the objective to assess the performance of the current transformer, reasonably high values for the $tan\left(\delta\right)$ were assumed (i.e. 0.05 to 0.2) since a lower loss tangent would require a higher resolution on the part of the current measurement.

\section{Design of a holder for the Debye Equivalent Circuit}
For a lossy medium the Debye Network consists at least of a vacuum capacity $C_0$ and the term for the charging of the additional capacitance. There might be . Thus, it is reasonable to design a holder for the network that can hold three strands with two components each. Moreover, it has to fit into the low-voltage and high-voltage test cell.

\section{Measurement of the textepsilon and the tan(textdelta) for the Debye model}

The aim is to have a current flwoing though the Debye model in the low-voltage setup that is oft the same order as a current in the high voltage-setup. In order to have a comparable current for a voltage that is $1/1000$ of the high-voltage setup a capacitance $C_0$ for the Debye is selected 1000 times higher than the Capacitance of the samples. As the sample has a capacitance of 3.44 pF its equivalent $C_0$ in the debye-model is 3.3 nF. In order to get a tan($\delta$) of !!! $R_i$ is chosen as and $C_i$ is chosen as .

\section{Need for an integrator}
The signal 
As the used 16-bit DAC has a limited resolution it is advantageous to use an integrator in order to spread the frequencies of the signal over a larger timescale. This makes it possible to detect the different frequencies more accurately with the same DAC. 
A second reason to make use of an integrator is due to the fact that it adds a $1/f$ dependency to the fourier spectrum of the voltage signal. As the fourier spectrum of the input signal is as well characterized by a $1/f$ decrease the division of the output voltage through the input voltage creates a ???
