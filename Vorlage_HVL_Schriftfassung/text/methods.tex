\section{Simulation of capacitance} \label{sec.analysecurrent}
The dependency of $C_0$ has to be simulated numerically for the high-voltage setup as well as for the low-voltage setup.

\section{Signal analysis of the Debye model}

In order to emulate different dielectrica with their own respective dielectric loss tangent, different combinations of circuit elements were used. Each different circuit accounts for another loss tangent with respect to frequency. With the objective to assess the performance of the current transformer, reasonably high values for the $tan\left(\delta\right)$ were assumed (i.e. 0.05 to 0.2) since a lower loss tangent would require a higher resolution on the part of the current measurement.

\section{Design of a holder for the Debye Equivalent Circuit}
For a lossy medium the Debye Network consists at least of a vacuum capacity $C_0$ and the term for the charging of the additional capacitance. There might be . Thus, it is reasonable to design a holder for the network that can hold three strands with two components each. Moreover, it has to fit into the low-voltage and high-voltage test cell.

\section{Measurement of the textepsilon and the tan(textdelta) for the Debye model}

The aim is to have a current flwoing though the Debye model in the low-voltage setup that is oft the same order as a current in the high voltage-setup. In order to have a comparable current for a voltage that is $1/1000$ of the high-voltage setup a capacitance $C_0$ for the Debye is selected 1000 times higher than the Capacitance of the samples. As the sample has a capacitance of 3.44 pF its equivalent $C_0$ in the debye-model is 3.3 nF. In order to get a tan($\delta$) of !!! $R_i$ is chosen as and $C_i$ is chosen as .

\section{Need for an integrator}
The signal 
As the used 16-bit DAC has a limited resolution it is advantageous to use an integrator in order to spread the frequencies of the signal over a larger timescale. This makes it possible to detect the different frequencies more accurately with the same DAC.
