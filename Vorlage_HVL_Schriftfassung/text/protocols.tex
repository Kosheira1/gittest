\section{Protocol: Measurement of capacitance of two samples}
\large{Aim} \\
\begin{itemize}

\item Measurement of capacitances of two samples in order to derive the $\epsilon$ with a measured electrode distance 
\item Optical measurement of electrode distance (done by Raphael F\"arber) 
\end{itemize}

\large{Used Instruments}

\end{itemize}

\large{Devices} \\

\large{Setup} \\
The input signal was  sinusoidal with 1kHz and $V_pp=16$. This signal is applied to two different samples in the low-voltage-setup. The current through the probe is measured with DLPCA, filtered with a Butterworth filter and then given to a ADC. 
Input signal and output current are measured and the division of these quantities allows to deduce $C*$.\\

Settings: \newline
Signal Generator:  sin, 1kHz, $V_pp=16$
DLPCA:  automatically adapted gain
BW-Filter:  cutoff-frequency : 100kHz, Gain: 1
