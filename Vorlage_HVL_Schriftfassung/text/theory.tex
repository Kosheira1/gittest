\subsection{Derivation of the effective $\epsilon$}
The effective permittivity is used to describe the permittivity of a composite material. This is necessary due to the fact that the assumption of homogeneity is not tenable for compound material. As the permittivity is proportional to the capacitance the effective permittivity can be obtained by the ratio of $C^*$ to the vacuum capacitance $C_0$.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{eff}(\omega)= \frac{C^*(\omega)}{C_0} 
\end{equation}
For the dielectric spectroscopy $\epsilon$ is received by

Whereas the effective permittivity can be derived quite easily from the permittivity of the different materials for layered material geometries this is not possible for a complex setup any more. Thus, a numerical simulation is required as described in chapter \ref{sec.sim_vac_comsol}. In order to get the effective $\epsilon$ the complex capacitance and the vacuum capacitance have to be obtained. While the former can be measured (voltage/current measurement) the latter has to be obtained with a numerical simulation. 
For the specimen in figure \ref{fig.specimen}, there are several geometric quantities that influence the vacuum capacity. The most important factor is the distance of the electrodes as it may vary considerably. As a consequence a lookup table has to be created that allows an estimation of d if $C_0$ is given.

 


\subsection{Interdependence between $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon_{eff}$} 
The estimation of the dielectric permittivity of the epoxy is based on the assumption that phase and magnitude of $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon_{eff}$ are decoupled. Thus, if one wants to estimate $\epsilon$ of the dielectric material one has to investigate the dependency of magnitude and phase of the $\epsilon$ on the $\epsilon_{eff}$ numerically. This effect can in general not be neglected as the the simulation for a layered capacitance proves.

\section{Part 2:  Suitability of current transformer for dielectric spectroscopy}


\subsection{Debye model}
The polarization effects in a dielectric material can be characterized by the (complex) relative permittivity and the resuling dielectric loss factor. Both are frequency-dependent quantities. 
For linear materials the polarization can be described by a network model. The Debye-ansatz assumes that the rate of change $ \frac{dP_i}{dt}$ is proportional to the difference between the remaining polarization $P_i(t)$ and the polarization at infinity $P_i(\infty$). This results in an exponential decay of the polarization function that tends towards $P_i(\infty)$. This exponential decay can be modeled with a time constant of a resistor and a capacitor in series ($\tau=R_i \cdot C_i$). Therefore, an emulated dielectric comprises of the vacuum capacitance, an additional capacity $C_i$ and a resistor $R_i$ and a resistor for a stationary conduction current $R_{\infty}$. 

\subsubsection{Derivation of maximum tan($\delta$)}
The aim of this section is to derive the formula for the maximum tan($\delta$) of the Debye model in order to adjust its value to a disired one.
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{eff}^* (\omega) = \frac{C^*(\omega)}{C_0}
\end{equation}

In Electrical Engineering, it is custom to define the  complex relative permittivity $\epsilon$ in the following way: 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon^* = \epsilon_r-j \cdot \epsilon_r''
\end{equation}

For the by the above mentioned debye-ansatz given delay of the dipole alignment one receives the following equations for the real and imaginary part of $\epsilon$ \cite{Kuchler}. 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon'_r = \epsilon_{\infty} + \frac{\epsilon_{stat}-\epsilon_{\infty}}{1+(\omega \cdot \tau )^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\epsilon''_r = \omega \cdot \tau \cdot \frac{\epsilon_{stat}-\epsilon_{\infty}}{1+(\omega \cdot \tau )^2}
\end{equation}

The loss tangents are given by:
\begin{equation}
tan (\delta) = \frac{\kappa + \omega \cdot \epsilon_0 \cdot \epsilon _r ''}{\omega \cdot \epsilon_0 \cdot \epsilon _r '}
\end{equation}
It can be split up in one part for the polarisation losses and another part for the conduction losses, which are given in the following equations. 
\begin{equation}
tan (\delta_{L}) = \frac{\kappa}{\omega \cdot \epsilon_0 \cdot \epsilon_r'} \newline
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
tan (\delta_{pol}) = \frac {\epsilon_r'' } {\epsilon_r'}
\end{equation}


We are measuring in the frequency domain from $10^{-6}$ Hz to $10^{11}$ Hz, thus the complex dielectric function can be deduced from a measurement of the time dependent dielectric function $\epsilon(t)$ as described above. 

\begin{equation}
\epsilon^*(\omega) = \frac{1}{j \omega  Z^*(\omega) C_0}
\end{equation}

The impedance is given by the chosen Debye model. 
\begin{equation}
Z_0(\omega)=[\frac{1}{R_\infty}+\frac{1}{R_i+\frac{1}{j \omega C_i}}+j \omega C_0]^{-1} = [\frac{1}{R_\infty}+\frac{j \omega C_i}{j\omega R_i  C_i+1}+j \omega C_0]^{-1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\epsilon^*(\omega)= \frac{[\frac{1}{R_\infty}+\frac{j \omega C_i}{j\omega C_i R_i  +1}+j \omega C_0]}{j \omega C_0} = \frac{1}{j \omega C_0 R_\infty}+ \frac{C_i/C_0}{j\omega C_i R_i  +1}+1
\end{equation}

The term for $\epsilon$ is splitted up into a real and an imaginary part. 

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_r' = 1+ \frac{C_i/C_0}{\omega^2 C_i^2 R_i^2 +1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_r'' = -j \left(\frac{1}{\omega C_0 R_\infty}+\frac{\omega C_i^2 R_i / C_0}{\omega^2 C_i^2 R_i^2 +1} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
tan(\delta) = tan(\delta_L) + tan( \delta_Pol) = \frac{\omega^2 \tau^2+1}{\omega C_0 R_\infty (2+ \omega^2 \tau^2)}+\frac{\omega \tau \Delta \epsilon}{\epsilon_{stat} + \omega^2 \tau^2}
\end{equation}

Its derivative is given by: 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial tan(\delta)}{ \partial \omega} & = \frac{[\omega C_0 R_\infty (2+\omega^2 \tau^2)]\cdot 2 \omega \tau^2 - (\omega^2 \tau^2 +1) [C_0 R_\infty (2+3 \omega^2 \tau^2)  }{[\omega C_0 R_\infty (2+\omega^2 \tau^2)]^2}\\
					      & + \frac{\tau \Delta \epsilon [\epsilon_{stat} + \omega^2 \tau^2] - 2 \omega \tau^2 [\omega \tau \Delta \epsilon]}{[\epsilon_{stat} +\omega^2 \tau^2]}
\label{eg:test}
					      \end{align}

in order to find the maximum of tan($\delta_{pol}$)the second part of the term above, i.e. \eqref{eg:test}, is set equal to 0 to get an algebraic expression
for the maximum value and its corresponding frequency.

\begin{equation}
\tau \Delta \epsilon [\epsilon_{stat} + \omega^2 \tau^2] -2\omega \tau^2 [\omega \tau \Delta \epsilon] = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 (\tau^3 \Delta \epsilon -2 \tau^3 \Delta \epsilon) = - \tau \Delta \epsilon \cdot \epsilon_{stat}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\omega^2 = \frac{\tau \Delta \epsilon \epsilon_{stat}}{\tau^3 \Delta \epsilon}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{stat}}{\tau^2}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\tan(\delta_L)_{max} = \frac{\epsilon_{stat} \Delta\epsilon}{2\epsilon_{stat}} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{stat}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Devices for high frequency current measurement}
The most common method for high frequency current measurement are shunt resistors. The make use of the the proportionality between the current and a voltage drop are proportional. They are passive and have high bandwidths up to the GHz area. Another advantage is their ability to monitor DC currents. In order to keep the reduction of the current rise speed in an acceptable area the self-inductance is often kept low by using coaxial shunts. \cite{highdynamiccurrent}
A current transformer (CT) or pulse transformer is an instrument transformer that creates an AC-signal on its secondary side that is proportional to the alternating current on its primary side. Most common are toroidal cores that are coiled. The secondary side has a low output resistor (usu. 50 $\Omega$).
The principle setup of a Current Transformer is shown in the following figure: 
\\CTs are especially suitable if the current on the primary side is too high to measure because the CT provides a current on the secondary side that is in a measurable area. A current transformer is suitable for current waveshapes and amplitudes from microamperes to megaamperes in high voltage circuits. Another advantage over a shunt resistance is due to the galvanic isolation of the secondary side from the primary. This galvanic isolation prohibits large currents on the secondary side during a  which might destroy the Butterworth-Filter or the Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC). 

The transfer function for the current transformer can be calculated with the following differential equation, that is derived from Ampere's law (deducation based on: \cite{highdynamiccurrent}).
\begin{equation}
U_B(t) + \frac{L_2}{R_B} \cdot \frac{dU_B(t)}{dt}=\frac{N_1}{N_2} \cdot L_2 \cdot \frac{dI_1(t)}{dt}
\end{equation}
This results in a complex transfer function of: 
\begin{equation}
U_B(s) = R_B \cdot \frac{N_1}{N_2} \cdot \frac{s \frac{L_2}{R_B}}{s \frac{L_2}{R_B} +1} \cdot I_1(s)
\end{equation}

With the time constant $T=\frac{L_2}{R_B}$ this is a high-pass filter with a lower corner frequency of 
\begin{equation}
f_u= \frac{1}{2 \pi T} = \frac{R_B}{2 \pi L_2}
\end{equation}

For frequencies above the corner frequency the transfer function is:
\begin{equation}
G_CT(s) = \frac{U_B(s)}{I_1(s)}=R_B \cdot \frac{N_1}{N_2}
\end{equation}

This simplified model ignores the resistance and inductance of the primary and secondary side.

\subsection{Clamping capability of Current Transformers }

\subsection{Noise Considerations}
\subsubsection{General}
The evaluation of noise added to the signal by the CT, the integrator, the BW-filter and the cables is of great importance as it limits the capability of measuring below-PD-currents though the capacitance of the specimen. 
In order to quantify the desired signal compared to the background noise, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can be measured. The SNR is a the ratio of signal power over signal noise. The power is proportional to the amplitude of the signal.
\begin{equation}
	SNR=\frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} = \left[\frac{V_{signal}}{V_{noise}}\right]^2
\end{equation}
The degradation of the SNR is characterized by its input value over its output value, which is the Noise Figure (NF) and is indicated in dB.
\begin{equation}
	NF = 10log\left(\frac{SNR_{in}}{SNR_{out}}\right)
\end{equation}
The amount of additional noise by the components can be characterized by the NF. 
\subsection{Noise of a Current Transformer}
A CT has an intrinsic noise that is caused by the Barkhausen noise of the magnetic core. It can be neglected as it is much lower than other sources of noise. %cite
Another noise source might occur due to the capacitive coupling of the primary wire to the copper case of the Current Transformer. This coupling capacitance might reach orders of a few picofarads. %\cite
