\chapter{Introduction}
Power Electronics, especially converters, lead to a more complex electrical field stress in insulation systems of energy transmission systems as it introduces pulses (>1 kV) with high slew rates and high repetition frequencies (> 1 kHz). Latter can cause a partial discharge (PD) in the insulation system, i.e. a transient breakdown of a part of the insulation system. \cite{TransformerEngineering}. The effects that . This results in an accelerated aging of the insulation as the PDs are sustained due to the repetition of the converter pulses.

In a new approach a quantification of the pre-breakdown modification should be obtained with the use of an online moitoring the dielectric permittivity for several harmonics \cite{FaerberMVISS}.
The first part of this semester project is required to get the dielectric permittivity by measuring the capacity of the specimen shown in figure \ref{fig.specimen}. When using a specimen for the first time it is assumed that it's dielectric permittivity is always the same. In order to be able to determine the distance of the two electrodes a reference measurement for the 

The second part of the project is the investigation of the suitability of current transformers in dielectric spectroscopy. For measuring very small below-PD currtents it is doubted that a current transformer does not deteriorate the signal in a way that an acceptable measurement is possible. The results prove that the use of a current transformer does deteriorate the guess of $\epsilon$ significantly. 

The investigation of suitability of a current transformer cannot be carried out with high-voltage as there is no adequate current-meter which gives a reference for the measurements with a current transformer. Thus, the feasibility study has to be carried out with a low-voltage setup.
